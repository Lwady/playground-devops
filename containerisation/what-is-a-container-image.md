Container images are built from a container file, which is a text file that contains instructions on how to create a container image. The container file specifies the base image, the application code, and any dependencies or configurations needed to run the application.

Container images have layers, which are essentially filesystems that are stacked on top of each other. Each layer represents a change or addition to the filesystem, and they are combined to create the final image. This layering system allows for efficient storage and sharing of images, as common layers can be reused across different images.
